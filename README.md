# Rasoi Planner - AI-Powered Indian Meal Planning

Welcome to Rasoi Planner, an intelligent meal planning application specifically designed for Indian households. This app combines traditional Indian cooking wisdom with modern AI technology to create personalized weekly meal plans.

## üöÄ What's New: AI Integration

The app now features **actual AI integration** that can generate intelligent, personalized meal plans using OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude APIs. The AI considers:

- **Your exact pantry inventory** and quantities
- **Regional cuisine preferences** (North Indian, South Indian, Bengali, etc.)
- **Dietary restrictions** (Vegetarian, Vegan, Jain, Gluten-free)
- **Family size and cooking time constraints**
- **Nutritional balance** across the week
- **Seasonal ingredient availability**
- **Cost optimization** for shopping lists

### AI Features

1. **Smart Recipe Generation**: AI creates authentic Indian recipes adapted to your pantry
2. **Nutritional Analysis**: Provides insights on nutritional balance and variety
3. **Intelligent Shopping Lists**: Optimized recommendations with cost estimates
4. **Fallback System**: Gracefully falls back to rule-based planning when AI is unavailable

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Basic Setup (Rule-based meal planning)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd rasoi-planner

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### AI-Enhanced Setup (Recommended)

To enable AI-powered meal planning, you'll need an API key from OpenAI or Anthropic:

1. **Get an API Key**:
   - **OpenAI**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key
   - **Anthropic**: Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and create an API key

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   # OR
   VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   
   # Choose your preferred AI service
   VITE_AI_SERVICE=openai  # or 'anthropic' or 'fallback'
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for GPT-4 integration | No | - |
| `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key for Claude integration | No | - |
| `VITE_AI_SERVICE` | Preferred AI service (`openai`, `anthropic`, or `fallback`) | No | `fallback` |
